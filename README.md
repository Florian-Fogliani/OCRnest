This project is an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** system, developed as part of the **second year of the integrated preparatory program at EPITA (SPE)**. It was carried out in a **group of four**.  

---
## 🧩 Overview

The OCR system consists of several components that work together to recognize and process text from images. These components include:

- **Solver**: Processes a grid-based text file and outputs recognized values.
- **UI**: Provides a user interface to interact with the system.
- **Pre-processing**: Performs image preprocessing, including rotation adjustments.
- **Cutter**: Analyzes and cuts parts of an image for further processing.
- **Clean**: Removes unnecessary files generated during processing.
- **Process**: Trains a neural network to accurately identify values from input images.
